## Hi there üëã
Hey, I‚Äôm Dipun Mohapatra, a curious, data-loving human who believes that great decisions come from good questions and even better insights.

I also believe the first step toward solving any problem is acknowledging that we have one. Nothing changes if nothing changes, right? That‚Äôs why I dig deep, question assumptions, and let data guide the way because real progress starts with clarity.

Personally, I‚Äôm someone who hates when things are said without facts. I question everything, not out of defiance, but from a genuine desire to understand what‚Äôs true, what‚Äôs useful, and what actually works. That mindset is what led me to data analytics in the first place.

I recently completed my MSc in Business Analytics from the University of Birmingham, where I worked on several hands-on academic projects that pushed both my technical skills and strategic thinking. From building a high-recall stroke prediction model to running Monte Carlo simulations for supplier risk, I explored challenges that demanded clarity, rigour, and a whole lot of curiosity.

Tools I use: SQL, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn), Power BI, Tableau, Microsoft Fabric

What I love: Challenging assumptions, finding patterns in noise, building dashboards that make people say ‚Äúwait, really‚Äù

Right now: Expanding my portfolio, diving into Microsoft Fabric (Microsoft's all stuff data in one place), and actively seeking roles where I can turn data into better decisions.

Let‚Äôs connect if you value evidence over guesswork, or just want to talk about analytics, insights, or why correlation does not equal causation.
